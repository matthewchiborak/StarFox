Falco;Okay everyone! I've been put in charge of testing and that's exactly what we're going to do.
Slippy;!!! Who said that!?
Falco;What are you talking about? I did.
Slippy;Falco? That's you? How come I can't see you?
Krystal;I see you're taking my advice and ignoring him...
Fox;What's this about not being able to see us?
Peppy;Yeah don't working ROB will have this all fixed in a moment.
ROB;Actually this problem can only be fixed with created animations from scratch. More time will be needed.
Krystal;Fantastic...
Falco;...Test successful.
